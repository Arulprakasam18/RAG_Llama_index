# RAG_Llama_index

##Using Llama index to build Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).


Large Language Models (LLMs) undergo training on vast datasets, but they lack training on your specific data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by incorporating your data into the existing dataset accessible to LLMs. References to RAG will be frequent throughout this documentation.

Within RAG, your data undergoes loading and preparation for queries, or “indexing”. User queries interact with this index, refining your data to the most pertinent context. This refined context, combined with your query, is then presented to the LLM alongside a prompt, from which the LLM generates a response.

Regardless of whether you’re developing a chatbot or an agent, familiarizing yourself with RAG techniques for integrating data into your application is essential

# Phases in RAG :


#Loading : This involves fetching your data from its source, be it text files, PDFs, websites, databases, or APIs, and integrating it into your pipeline. LlamaHub offers a wide array of connectors for this purpose.

API : (LLM : openai)

data connector is simpledirectory reader.Simply pass in a input directory or a list of files. It will select the best file reader based on the file extensions.

#Indexing : This entails structuring the data in a manner conducive to efficient querying. For LLMs, this typically involves generating vector embeddings, numerical representations of the semantic meaning of the data, alongside various metadata strategies to facilitate precise retrieval of contextually relevant information


summary index is a simple data structure where nodes are stored in a sequence. During index construction, the document texts are chunked up, converted to nodes, and stored in a list.

#Storing : Once your data is organized and indexed, it’s prudent to store both the index and associated metadata to prevent the need for re-indexing.


#Querying : At its simplest, querying is just a prompt call to an LLM: it can be a question and get an answer, or a request for summarization, or a much more complex instruction with various indexing techniques in place, there are myriad ways to leverage LLMs and Llama Index data structures for querying, including sub-queries, multi-step queries, and hybrid approaches.


tree_summarize : The tree index is a tree-structured index, where each node is a summary of the children nodes. During index construction, the tree is constructed in a bottoms-up fashion until we end up with a set of root_nodes.

#Evaluating : An indispensable phase in any pipeline is evaluating its effectiveness compared to alternative strategies or after modifications. Evaluation furnishes objective metrics regarding the accuracy, fidelity, and speed of responses to queries.

# Bringing it all together
There are countless applications for data-driven LLMs, broadly falling into three categories:

Query Engines: These engines form complete pipelines enabling users to pose inquiries across their data. They accept natural language queries and furnish responses, supplemented by relevant context retrieved and supplied to the LLM.

Chat Engines: These engines establish end-to-end pipelines for engaging in dialogues with data, involving multiple exchanges rather than single question-and-answer interactions.

Agents: Agents are automated decision-makers empowered by LLMs, interfacing with the environment through a toolkit. They can undertake numerous steps to accomplish tasks, dynamically determining the optimal course of action instead of adhering to predefined sequences. This affords them greater adaptability in addressing intricate tasks.
